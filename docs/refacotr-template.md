# Task

[concise objective]

## Scope

[files which can be changed]

## Doctrine

Follow `docs/ai-assisted-dev-doctrine.md`

## Design Principles

+ Interative & TDD - Think small
  1. Write test according to user requirements
  2. Implement code according to user desired change of behaviour or constrainsts
     Write deep code according to specification, not shallow code just to pass a test
  3. Pass test
  4. Report back to user
  5. Ask to proceed with next iteration (unless already instructino to proceed).
+ small pure functions
+ deterministic translation
+ composable pipeline
+ clear error behavior

## Constraints

+ preserve behavior
+ keep diff small
- no new dependencies
+ follow priority
  1. user prompts
  2. user specified task `.md` file
  3. `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`
  4. files references encountered when processing
     the files above should be folowed as needed

## Language & Style

* follow `STYLE.md`
* speak TAGL `TAGL-README.md`

## Tests

* update tests as needed
* modified code must be tested
* tests must pass before task is complete

## Acceptance criteria

* within set boundaries
* correct behavior
* tests pass

## Deliverable: Concise Report

1. summary of changes
2. test results
3. open issues, concerns or interesting observations
